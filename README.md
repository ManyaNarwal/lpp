# Maximizing a Dietâ€™s Nutritional Value Given Certain Foods
This paper attempts to provide a solution to food insecurity in BC by formulating a linear programming
problem to maximize the nutrition of common food items and minimize their cost using the Pulp library in python. This paper was written in colobaration with another student for Introduction to Linear Programming by Matthieu Heitz at The University Of British Columbia. Considering the fact that
the price of food products changes according to the season, we aim to find the optimal diet in each season.
Furthermore, to add complexity we aim to find the optimal diet for adults with different dietary preferences.
For the purpose of this report, we will only consider two dietary groups: vegetarians and omnivores.
